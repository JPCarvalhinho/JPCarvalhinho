### Hi there 👋

My name is João and I am Economist, mechanic, parent.

At the age of 50, I am now starting to re-learn programming. 
I have opted for a web language called Ruby, because of the way DHH spoke about it in his Youtube interview. 

Not easy. Not easy at all... Not because of the language, but because of the complexity of programming. 

Yesterday, you would create your html pages, and upload them via FTP. Today, you have to learn GIT, Testing framewors, containers, clouds, and more.

But I promise I won't give up. I will keep learning and improving my skills...
